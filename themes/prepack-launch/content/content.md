##Pico -- PrePacked


> Pico is a flat file CMS, this means there is no administration backend and database to deal with. You simply create .md files in the "content" folder and that becomes a page.


If you are looking for a simple easy to use database free, lightweight CMS, Pico is the probably best PHP solution you will probably find, developed by  [Gilbert Pellegrom](http://gilbert.pellegrom.me) founder of [Dev7studios](http://dev7studios.com/) the guys that created Nivo Slider. Pico uses Markdown files stored in your content folder to create pages and Twig to generate themes, no drama, no fuss.	

						
 PrePacked is a fork of Pico that we modified and packed with some of our favorite plugins then added some of our own to make it simple and easy for us to build and deploy Pico based websites. The idea behind the fork is to make Pico development, install and deployment friendlier for everyone.
